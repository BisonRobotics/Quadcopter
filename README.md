# Quadcopter
Basic_Receive - Code that runs on the Arduino used for the Quadcopter.<br\>
Basic_Send - Code that runs on the Arduino attached to a controller PC.<br\>
GUI - Java Graphical User Interface for communicating with Quadcopter (Only tested and run under Windows 8.1 OS).<br\>
motor_test - Can be used to send values to an esc to control a motor.<br\>
Libraries - Contains the libraries necessary to run the code.<br\>

Notes: Basic_Receive and Basic_Send are commented fairly well. GUI will be cleaned up over Spring Break. Currently the serial communication is down and the code is poorly commented.
